## What I have been doing so far

1. Researching about what is TLE data
2. Understanding Celestrack API endpoints
3. Implementing the GCS mobile app API client for Celestrack
4. Designing the GCS MobileApp user interface
5. Learning React Native and its libraries(react-native-apps, etc.)
6. Learning how an ESP32 LoRa antenna works, and how it can be used for satellite tracking.

## What needs to be done

1. Polish the UI.
2. Develop a Celestrack client with Axios in the application.
3. Find a way to access the antenna through the phone cable.
4. Find a way to process the antenna data into a usable and standard way.
5. Develop an analytics section(which satellites are on orbit at this moment, the ones coming up in the next few hours, etc.)
6. Buy the materials for the antenna

## Difficulties

1. WiFi
2. Setting up the development environment(had to reinstall the operating system, setup Android Studio, etc.)
3. Enabling KVM(Kernel-based Virtual Machine) virtualization in the BIOS for hardware acceleration(it was required for the Android Emulator)
